#Can you replace elsif with a sequence of if-else combinations?
#You can in some situations, but it depends on how each if/else is written. It also means that Ruby will check every if-else combination, rather than just the first false ones like it would with if-elsif-else. Try to make some of these to figure out the differences.

#How do I tell whether a number is between a range of numbers?
#Use && (and) to test if the number is x > 1 and x < 10. Also remember you can use <= (less-than-equal) and similar tests too.
