my_ferret = blog or blogpost.new
my_ferret.set_name= "title of blog post"
ferret_name = my_blog_post.get_name

BlogPost.current_count
puts BlogPost.inspect
puts my_blog_post.inspect

puts "#{ferretname} says #{my_ferret.squeal},
#{parrotname} says #{my_parrot.tweet},
and #{chincillaname} says #{my_chincilla.squeek}."
